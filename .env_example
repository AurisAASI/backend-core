# This file contains all required environment variables for the project.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values.
# 
# Note: During serverless deployment, STAGE/REGION are set via --stage flag.
# For local development and debugging, set them here to test against specific environments.
# Queue URLs are automatically created by serverless deployment (CloudFormation).

# SQS Queue URLs - AUTO-CONFIGURED BY SERVERLESS DEPLOYMENT
# =============================================================================
# DO NOT SET THESE MANUALLY - They are automatically created and injected 
# by CloudFormation during serverless deployment.
#
# During local development/testing:
# - If queue URLs are not set, SQS operations are gracefully skipped
# - This is expected behavior - queues only exist on deployed stacks
# - No action needed - just informational warnings will appear in logs
#
# The following queue URLs are auto-injected during deployment:
# - SCRAPER_TASK_QUEUE_URL: For gmaps scraper tasks
# - WEBSITE_SCRAPER_TASK_QUEUE_URL: For website scraper tasks  
# - COMPANY_FEDERAL_SCRAPER_TASK_QUEUE_URL: For federal data scraper tasks
# - OPERATIONS_QUEUE_URL: For general operations routing
#
# After serverless deployment, these will be available in Lambda environment
